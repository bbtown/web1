<h2>What is SolveSpark?</h2>
<p>
SolveSpark is the world's first centralized \"crowdsolving\" platform that invites all people to post ideas, insights, and problems, in order to create traction and build positive change.

SolveSpark will not only help us hear the voices of those who are commonly underrepresented, but it will also collect daily insights that can yield the power to fight cancer, mitigate climate change, and end hunger.

More importantly, SolveSpark offers transparency in the problem-solving process and gives the world the power to fight corruption.
</p><p>
This platform will utilize intuitive analytics and will seamlessly integrate simple project management-based tools to help users define the problem, dig to its root cause, and find the best solutions. This will enable users to "crowd-solve" problems together in a methodical, comprehensive, and transparent manner.
</p><p>
SolveSpark's data analytics will undergo continuous improvement to derive meaning from user feedback and optimize problem solving guidance. Analytics will help users identify vulnerabilities, such as risks, information gaps, and flaws in reasoning such as group-think and biases. The underlying algorithms will be publicly available to foster transparency and continuous improvement. The interface will remain simple, yet customizable to reach the broadest audiences and maximize potential.
</p><p>
SolveSpark's goal is to include the entire world; the more input we gather, the better our solutions will be. Every day, people have valuable insights into problems and potential solutions. Currently, there are few ways to effectively cultivate these thoughts before they are quickly forgotten.
</p><p>
SolveSpark will capture these precious day-to-day insights and give people a voice. Cumulatively, these insights will not only spark countless revelations, but inspire a philosophy of positivity, transparency, and empowerment by showing people that together, we will solve the world's toughest challenges.
</p>

<div class="row">
<h2>What are the key problems SolveSpark is trying to solve?</h2>
<p>
    SolveSpark addresses several problems:
    <ul>
<li>Incomplete approach to world problems</li>
<li>No voice for the under-privileged</li>
<li>Lack of transparency/accountability</li>
<li>Wasting precious thought capital</li>
<li> <i>Slacktivism</i> is not engagement</li>
<li>Unsound problem solving</li>
<li>Little coordination between efforts</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
Chasms exist between decision-makers working to solve critical problems and those actually suffering through crises. SolveSpark gives voices to everyone, including the under-privileged, introducing transparency, accountability, and more comprehensive decision-making.
</p><p>
Most initiatives only seek input from thinkers and philanthropists. By failing to capture everyone's insights, we waste vast amounts of precious intellect.
</p><p>
  Two primary ways to support causes online exist-- donate money or click <i>share</i>. SolveSpark's alternative to <i>Slacktivism</i> is active constructive engagement.
</p><p>
Many idea sites put the cart before the horse; SolveSpark discourages skipping key steps before selecting solutions.
</p><p>
SolveSpark creates a centralized location for causes to raise awareness, encouraging causes to join forces, focus their efforts, and maximize impact.

<h2>Who is SolveSpark's primary customer?</h2>
<p>
    SolveSpark aims to reach all people and spark positive change throughout the world. Specific groups impacted by SolveSpark:
<ul>
<li>Charity and non-profit organizations will see the general public voicing their opinions on issues that overlap with the organization's missions and may see an increase in awareness, support, and new ideas.</li>
<li>Governments worldwide may need to change policy and operations to accommodate changes that are demanded.</li>
<li>Researchers may contribute valuable information to SolveSpark, or use discussions as a source of information to drive analysis.</li>
<li>Entrepreneurs can capitalize on a new need once it has been identified. </li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>


<div class="row">
<h2>Who are SolveSpark's competitors?  What is SolveSpark's competetive advantage?</h2>
<p>
SolveSpark will challenge users to think critically before arriving at a solution. Many sites promote doing great things, but SolveSpark promotes doing great things responsibly by engaging all stakeholders, defining the problem, outlining requirements, assessing risks, and comparing top solutions.
</p><p>
It excites me greatly that there are a growing number of amazing sites geared towards growing ideas (such as ThinkItUp and IdeaScale), project management services (such as BaseCamp and Pivotal), and crowdfunding sites. Although these sites can be seen as competition, I choose to see them as inspiration, and even potential partners. SolveSpark will close a gap in the problem-solving process and complement existing services. Partnering with other services would potentially create force multipliers, advancing every cause. 
</p>
</div>


<div class="row">
<h2>What is SolveSpark's key innovation?</h2>
<p>
   In addition to bringing solid project management practices to the problem-solving process, SolveSpark aims to be a forerunner in data analytics. Analytics will not only process and provide insight into user input and but will also utilize additional user input, such as ratings, to help verify the accuracy of the results and improve algorithms.
</p><p>
Sentiment analysis will help summarize viewpoints, pattern recognition will help detect missing pieces and flaws in logic, and ratings input by users will help rank and organize data.
</p><p>
Analytics will produce infographics that are intuitive, meaningful, and insightful. Interactive simulations will allow users to manipulate and visualize data. Statistical analysis will help decision-makers select a solution.
</p><p>
SolveSpark also seeks to preserve freedom of speech and will explore creating anonymity for users who fear retaliation or other consequences from speaking out. This must be carefully balanced to prevent fraudulent activities.
